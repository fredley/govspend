# govspend is a repo of government spending data

It's based on the data published at data.gov.uk to articulate spend over Â£25k, and I'm using it to evaluate whether the data is good enough to draw conclusions. I'll let you know.




Before you call the rozzer, all the original data is in the public domain under OGL 2, so don't worry.
